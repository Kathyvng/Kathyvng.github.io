Moving to San Francisco, I always had an affinity to things "disruptive". After taking ISTM. 654 in my MBA course for Information system and process, I learned the business side of new emerging technology and its theory. This sparked an interest in technology and how business use technology to leverage not only a "network effect" but also solving problems within old models. I learned about *exponential organizations* [Exponential Organizations explained by the author of the book--Salim Ismail](https://youtu.be/FNQSM4ipZog) and their models. They leverage their assets using little physical resources by connecting others (sharing economy) through a digital platform. All fields of business use technology. This is something I later grasp meaning in my 2nd year of MBA. I am now concentrating on digital innovation and information systems. 


In the midst of all that, I stumbled upon Flatiron school. Did some research on the co-founder Avi and his story was inspired by the "disruptive" nature of education. I decided to take a leap of faith in the school, that in which I find both challenging and rewarding thus far. I am taking Flatiron program to help teach myself not only to code but also to develop technical aspect. Gaining appreciation for the craft is key in knowing how to leverage it's usage in the business world. Especially when using the tools to strategize ways of breaking an old business system. You must break things apart to truely understand its nature. All building blocks of matter started with a tiny atom. This is my tiny atom, I hope to build something bigger for the world to share.
