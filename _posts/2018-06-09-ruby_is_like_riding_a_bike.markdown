The funny thing is my bike is named after Ruby. I just finished my intro to Ruby lessons. Between procedural and object oriented, I find that object oriented makes more sense in programming and streamlines the process. Programming requires practice, lots of it to understand the building blocks. My muscles right now are priming and I'm excited for the next steps in my journey. 

It's been challenging with my MBA and full time job. Considering both consumes my mental space. But I feel that time spent practicing programming gives more quality to my mental home. I am more alert to data structures at work and in my MBA program. 

I hope after the month of June, I'll be able to be more proactive in my practice and start to get a better grasps of these abstract concepts and learn the language well. 

Until then, toodles!
